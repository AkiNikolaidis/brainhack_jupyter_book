# Brainhack Book
Since the first Brainhack in 2012, the Brainhack community has dynamically grown and inspired a culture of open, inclusive, community-driven neuroscience. In August 2020, Neuron invited a Brainhack Neuroview piece, and the Brainhack community has worked together on this manuscript that highlights the vision, features and impact of Brainhacks â€“ for individual researchers, the community, and science in general.  

We collectively aimed to include as much of the Brainhack community as possible in writing this piece by extending an open invitation across Brainhack channels of communication.
